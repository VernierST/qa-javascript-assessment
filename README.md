Vernier QA JavaScript Assessment
================================

## Instructions

Please take around 30 minutes to show your proficiency with writing tests in
JavaScript. The component to test, _vernier-app_, makes a network request and
renders a list based on the response. There are multiple ways to solve for the
test scenario. Be prepared to discuss your solution, alternatives, and
trade-offs.

1. Clone the repo
1. Do `npm install`
1. Fill in the test in test/vernier-app.test.js where indicated,
   `// Complete this test`
1. Do `npm test` to see if everything passes
1. Open a PR with your work
1. Let the hiring manager know the PR is up

## Scripts

- `start` runs your app for development, reloading on file changes
- `start:build` runs your app after it has been built using the build command
- `build` builds your app and outputs it in your `dist` directory
- `test` runs your test suite with Web Test Runner
- `lint` runs the linter for your project
- `format` fixes linting and formatting errors

## Tooling configs

For most of the tools, the configuration is in the `package.json` to reduce the amount of files in your project.

If you customize the configuration a lot, you can consider moving them to individual files.
